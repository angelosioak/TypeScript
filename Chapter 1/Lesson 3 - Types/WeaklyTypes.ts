/*
    - JavaScript is weakly typed.
    - This means that even though you create a variable or property and assign a value of a certain
    type, you can switch types on the run:
*/

let val = 1234 // OK!
val = 'Onetwothreefour'; // Reassignment. Still OK!

let val2 = { a : 3} + 5;
// [object Object]5! What does that even mean?
