/*
    - TypeScript is strongly typed.
    - This means that once you assign a value of a certain type, typeScript wants you to stick with it.
    - This also means that you can't use operators on values of different types, as they usually don't make sense.
*/

// You want to add a number to an object? Why??
let val = { a : 3} + 5;

/*
    - If you are used to reusing variables or adding numbers and strings on the fly, you might feel
    a little bit restricted when using TypeScript.
